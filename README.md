Repository to keep various scripts typically used for parsing and processing sequence data.

Most scripts are run with perl, typically run in the terminal with the following generalized format:
     perl script.pl command_line_options > output_filename

Sometimes the scripts will vary from this format, and the way to get information about how to run each script is from:
	  perl script.pl

This will usually provide an indication of how to run the scripts. They do not typically have much information, but if you want more info, please contact me. There is not typically a --help or -h flag associated with it, so do not assume this will give info.
